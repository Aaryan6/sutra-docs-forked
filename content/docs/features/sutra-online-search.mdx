### üß™ Quickstart: Fetching Latest AI News with SUTRA-V2

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher.
- SUTRA API key from [https://www.two.ai/sutra/api](https://www.two.ai/sutra/api).
- Basic familiarity with HTTP requests in Python.

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

Ensure you have Python installed. You‚Äôll use the built-in `http.client` library, so no additional packages are required.

Set your SUTRA API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export SUTRA_API_KEY="your-sutra-api-key"
```

#### Step 2: Use SUTRA-V2‚Äôs Online Search Feature

Create a Python script to query the latest AI news using SUTRA-V2‚Äôs online search capability:

```python
import http.client
import json
import os

# Establish connection to Two.ai API
conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("api.two.ai")

# Prepare the request payload
payload = json.dumps({
    "model": "sutra-v2",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Give me the latest news on artificial intelligence as of May 27, 2025."
        }
    ],
    "max_tokens": 100,
    "temperature": 0.3,
    "stream": False,
    "extra_body": {
        "online_search": True
    }
})

# Set up headers with your API key
headers = {
    'Content-Type': "application/json",
    'Authorization': "Bearer sutra api key here"
}

try:
    # Send the request
    conn.request("POST", "/v2/chat/completions", payload, headers)

    # Get and process the response
    res = conn.getresponse()
    data = res.read()

    # Print the response
    print(data.decode("utf-8"))

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error occurred: {e}")

finally:
    conn.close()
```

#### Step 3: Run the Script

Execute the script to fetch the latest AI news. On May 27, 2025, SUTRA-V2 might return news like:

- Researchers at Sussex University are exploring AI consciousness using the "Dreamachine" project, investigating whether AI could become sentient as large language models evolve.
- Google DeepMind‚Äôs CEO, Demis Hassabis, warned that AI will disrupt jobs within 5 years, urging teens to prepare by becoming "AI ninjas" and mastering the technology.

These updates reflect SUTRA-V2‚Äôs ability to pull real-time web data, ensuring you get the most current information available.

### üß† Best Practices for Online Search with SUTRA-V2

- **Enable Online Search**: Always set `"online_search": True` in the `extra_body` of your payload to activate this feature.
- **Specify Dates**: For time-sensitive queries, include the date in your prompt (e.g., "as of May 27, 2025") to ensure accurate results.
- **Limit Response Length**: Use `max_tokens` (e.g., 100) to keep responses concise for news summaries.
- **Handle Errors**: Add error handling (as shown in the script) to manage network issues or API errors gracefully.
- **Use Low Temperature**: A `temperature` of 0.3 ensures more factual and deterministic responses for news queries.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Recommended Parameters for Online Search

| Parameter     | Purpose                | Recommended for V2        |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `temperature` | Controls randomness    | 0.3 for factual output    |
| `max_tokens`  | Limits response length | 100‚Äì200 for summaries     |
| `extra_body`  | Enables online search  | `{"online_search": True}` |

### üîó API Access (cURL)

Test the SUTRA-V2 online search feature directly with a cURL command:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.two.ai/v2/chat/completions \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $SUTRA_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "model": "sutra-v2",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Give me the latest news on artificial intelligence as of May 27, 2025."}
  ],
  "max_tokens": 100,
  "temperature": 0.3,
  "extra_body": {"online_search": True}
}'
```

---

### üõ† Troubleshooting

- **Invalid API Key**: Ensure `SUTRA_API_KEY` is set in your environment variables and correctly included in the `Authorization` header.
- **Online Search Not Working**: Verify that `"online_search": True` is set in the `extra_body` of your payload.
- **Incomplete Responses**: Increase `max_tokens` if the news summary is cut off (e.g., try 200).
- **Network Errors**: Check your internet connection and ensure the Two.ai API endpoint (`https://api.two.ai/v2`) is accessible.
- **Outdated Information**: Include the current date in your prompt to ensure SUTRA-V2 fetches the latest data.
